    <p class="s">
        Hey there! I'm Bella Ingabire, a frontend developer with a passion for crafting beautiful and functional websites. <br>I thrive on turning ideas into reality through code and design.
        
        <br> <br><br>My journey into web development began with a curiosity for how websites work and a desire to create impactful experiences online. <br> Over the years, I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build responsive and intuitive user interfaces.
        
        With a keen eye for detail and a commitment to user experience, I strive to create websites that not only look great but also provide seamless navigation and accessibility for all users.
        
        Outside of coding, I draw inspiration from art, nature, and everyday life. <br>I believe that great design is all around us, and I'm constantly seeking new ways to incorporate fresh ideas into my work.
        
        I'm excited to share my portfolio with you and showcase some of my favorite projects. <br>From sleek landing pages to interactive web apps, each project reflects my dedication to excellence and creativity in frontend development.
        
        <br> <br><br>  Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I'm looking forward to connecting with you and collaborating on exciting projects together!
